### Deep NLP for hate speech detection

- Hate speech detection is the automated task of determining whether a piece of text contains hateful content. In this project, I built a classifier using 
 PyTorch to fine-tune a BERT model.

### Using multi-level modelling in R to investigate the drivers of Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy
In many tasks, failing to account for the hierarchical relations and autocorrelations between data can create "ecological fallacies" which misguide our interpretation of the data. In this project, I use mutli-level regression modelling to account for spatial autocorrelation and study reasons for Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy.

<!-- ## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio

Hello! My name is Matt, and I set up this page to showcase some of the data science projects I've been working on.

At age 18, while working as a cold caller in a telesales team at Ovo Energy, I built my first data product: a recommendation engine which predicted customers' propensity to buy. The tool helped me double my sales rate and, after I'd persuaded senior managers to take it into production, boosted our whole team's sales by 10%. 

The reason I tell this story is because I think it shows what data can and should be: a tool for empowering people and uplifting businesses. 

In the past 8 years, I've studied at two of the world's best universities and worked in a variety of industries, gaining experience in machine learning, strategy, analytics and marketing. My [CV](https://mattschapman.github.io/pdf/Matt_Chapman_CV.pdf) has plenty of information about the professional projects I've worked on, but the purpose of this page is to showcase some of my favourite personal (on-the-side) projects in a more visual way. 

If you have any questions, feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:mattchapmanmsc@gmail.com) or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-chapman-ba8488118/). 

Thanks for reading,

Matt

<!--  ### Using BERT and NaÃ¯ve Bayes models for helpfulness prediction of Amazon reviews
The quality and helpfulness of online reviews can vary greatly, meaning readers must often sift through a deluge of online reviews in order to find the most relevant ones. In this project, I compared the performance of various ML models for predicting the helpfulness of an Amazon review given its text and metadata.
